Summing Up
Welcome!
All the prior weeks have presented you with the fundamental building blocks of programming.
All you have learned in C will enable you to implement these building blocks in higher-level programming languages such as Python.
Today, we are going to talk about organizing data in memory and design possibilities that emerge from your growing knowledge.
Data Structures
Data structures
essentially are forms of organization in memory.
There are many ways to organize data in memory.
Abstract data structures
are those that we can conceptually imagine. When learning about computer science, itâs often useful to begin with these conceptual data structures. Learning these will make it easier later to understand how to implement more concrete data structures.
Stacks and Queues
Queues
are one form of abstract data structure.
Queues have specific properties. Namely, they are
FIFO
or âfirst in first out.â You can imagine yourself in a line for a ride at an amusement park. The first person in the line gets to go on the ride first. The last person gets to go on the ride last.
Queues have specific actions associated with them. For example, an item can be
enqueued
; that is, the item can join the line or queue. Further, an item can be
dequeued
or leave the queue once it reaches the front of the line.
Queues contrast a
stack
. Fundamentally, the properties of a stack are different than a queue. Specifically, it is
LIFO
or âlast in first out.â Just like stacking trays in a cafeteria, a tray that is placed in a stack last is the first that may be picked up.
Stacks have specific actions associated with them. For example,
push
places something on top of a stack.
Pop
is removing something from the top of the stack.
In code, you might imagine a stack as follows:
typedef
struct
{
person
people
[
CAPACITY
];
int
size
;
}
stack
;
Notice that an array called people is of type
person
. The
CAPACITY
is how high the stack could be. The integer
size
is how full the stack actually is, regardless of how much it
could
hold.
You might imagine that the above code has a limitation. Since the capacity of the array is always predetermined in this code. Therefore, the stack may always be oversized. You might imagine only using one place in the stack out of 5000.
It would be nice for our stack to be dynamic â able to grow as items are added to it.
Jack Learns the Facts
We watched a video called
Jack Learns the Facts
by Professor Shannon Duvall of Elon University.
Resizing Arrays
Rewinding to Week 2, we introduced you to your first data structure.
An array is a block of contiguous memory.
You might imagine an array as follows:
In memory, there are other values being stored by other programs, functions, and variables. Many of these may be unused garbage values that were utilized at one point but are available now for use.
Imagine you wanted to store a fourth value
4
in our array? What would be needed is to allocate a new area of memory and move the old array to a new one. Initially, this new area of memory would be populated with garbage values.
As values are added to this new area of memory, old garbage values would be overwritten.
Eventually, all old garbage values would be overwritten with our new data.
One of the drawbacks of this approach is that itâs bad design: Every time we add a number, we have to copy the array item by item.
Wouldnât it be nice if we were able to put the
4
somewhere else in memory? By definition, this would no longer be an array because
4
would no longer be in contiguous memory.
In your terminal, type
code list.c
and write code as follows:
// Implements a list of numbers with an array of fixed size
#include
<stdio.h>
int
main
(
void
)
{
// List of size 3
int
list
[
3
];
// Initialize list with numbers
list
[
0
]
=
1
;
list
[
1
]
=
2
;
list
[
2
]
=
3
;
// Print list
for
(
int
i
=
0
;
i
<
3
;
i
++
)
{
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
list
[
i
]);
}
}
Notice that the above is very much like what we learned earlier in this course. We have memory being preallocated for three items.
Building upon our knowledge obtained more recently, we can leverage our understanding of pointers to create a better design in this code. Modify your code as follows:
// Implements a list of numbers with an array of dynamic size
#include
<stdio.h>
#include
<stdlib.h>
int
main
(
void
)
{
// List of size 3
int
*
list
=
malloc
(
3
*
sizeof
(
int
));
if
(
list
==
NULL
)
{
return
1
;
}
// Initialize list of size 3 with numbers
list
[
0
]
=
1
;
list
[
1
]
=
2
;
list
[
2
]
=
3
;
// List of size 4
int
*
tmp
=
malloc
(
4
*
sizeof
(
int
));
if
(
tmp
==
NULL
)
{
free
(
list
);
return
1
;
}
// Copy list of size 3 into list of size 4
for
(
int
i
=
0
;
i
<
3
;
i
++
)
{
tmp
[
i
]
=
list
[
i
];
}
// Add number to list of size 4
tmp
[
3
]
=
4
;
// Free list of size 3
free
(
list
);
// Remember list of size 4
list
=
tmp
;
// Print list
for
(
int
i
=
0
;
i
<
4
;
i
++
)
{
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
list
[
i
]);
}
// Free list
free
(
list
);
return
0
;
}
Notice that a list of size three integers is created. Then, three memory addresses can be assigned the values
1
,
2
, and
3
. Then, a list of size four is created. Next, the list is copied from the first to the second. The value for the
4
is added to the
tmp
list. Since the block of memory that
list
points to is no longer used, it is freed using the command
free(list)
. Finally, the compiler is told to point
list
pointer now to the block of memory that
tmp
points to. The contents of
list
are printed and then freed.
Itâs useful to think about
list
and
tmp
as both signs that point at a chunk of memory. As in the example above,
list
at one point
pointed
to an array of size 3. By the end,
list
was told to point to a chunk of memory of size 4. Technically, by the end of the above code,
tmp
and
list
both pointed to the same block of memory.
One may be tempted to allocate way more memory than required for the list, such as 30 items instead of the required 3 or 4. However, this is bad design as it taxes system resources when they are not potentially needed. Further, there is little guarantee that memory for more than 30 items will be needed eventually.
Linked Lists
In recent weeks, you have learned about three useful primitives. A
struct
is a data type that you can define yourself. A
.
in
dot notation
allows you to access variables inside that structure. The
*
operator is used to declare a pointer or dereference a variable.
Today, you are introduced to the
->
operator. It is an arrow. This operator goes to an address and looks inside of a structure.
A
linked list
is one of the most powerful data structures within C. A linked list allows you to include values that are located at varying areas of memory. Further, they allow you to dynamically grow and shrink the list as you desire.
You might imagine three values stored at three different areas of memory as follows:
How could one stitch together these values in a list?
We could imagine this data pictured above as follows:
We could utilize more memory to keep track of where the next item is.
Notice that NULL is utilized to indicate that nothing else is
next
in the list.
By convention, we would keep one more element in memory, a pointer, that keeps track of the first item in the list.
Abstracting away the memory addresses, the list would appear as follows:
These boxes are called
nodes
. A
node
contains both an
item
and a pointer called
next
. In code, you can imagine a node as follows:
typedef
struct
node
{
int
number
;
struct
node
*
next
;
}
node
;
Notice that the item contained within this node is an integer called
number
. Second, a pointer to a node called
next
is included, which will point to another node somewhere in memory.
Conceptually, we can imagine the process of creating a linked list. First,
node *list
is declared, but it is of a garbage value.
Next, a node called
n
is allocated in memory.
Next, the
number
of node is assigned the value
1
.
Next, the nodeâs
next
field is assigned
NULL
.
Next,
list
is pointed at the memory location to where
n
points.
n
and
list
now point to the same place.
A new node is then created. Both the
number
and
next
field are both filled with garbage values.
The
number
value of
n
âs node (the new node) is updated to
2
.
Also, the
next
field is updated as well.
Most important, we do not want to lose our connection to any of these nodes lest they be lost forever. Accordingly,
n
âs
next
field is pointed to the same memory location as
list
.
Finally,
list
is updated to point at
n
. We now have a linked list of two items.
To implement this in code, modify your code as follows:
// Prepends numbers to a linked list, using while loop to print
#include
<cs50.h>
#include
<stdio.h>
#include
<stdlib.h>
typedef
struct
node
{
int
number
;
struct
node
*
next
;
}
node
;
int
main
(
int
argc
,
char
*
argv
[])
{
// Memory for numbers
node
*
list
=
NULL
;
// For each command-line argument
for
(
int
i
=
1
;
i
<
argc
;
i
++
)
{
// Convert argument to int
int
number
=
atoi
(
argv
[
i
]);
// Allocate node for number
node
*
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof
(
node
));
if
(
n
==
NULL
)
{
return
1
;
}
n
->
number
=
number
;
n
->
next
=
NULL
;
// Prepend node to list
n
->
next
=
list
;
list
=
n
;
}
// Print numbers
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
while
(
ptr
!=
NULL
)
{
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
ptr
->
number
);
ptr
=
ptr
->
next
;
}
// Free memory
ptr
=
list
;
while
(
ptr
!=
NULL
)
{
node
*
next
=
ptr
->
next
;
free
(
ptr
);
ptr
=
next
;
}
}
Notice that what the user inputs at the command line is put into the
number
field of a node called
n
, and then that node is added to the
list
. For example,
./list 1 2
will put the number
1
into the
number
field of a node called
n
, then put a pointer to
list
into the
next
field of the node, and then update
list
to point to
n
. That same process is repeated for
2
. Next,
node *ptr = list
creates a temporary variable that points at the same spot that
list
points to. The
while
prints what at the node
ptr
points to, and then updates
ptr
to point to the
next
node in the list. Finally, all the memory is freed.
In this example, inserting into the list is always in the order of \(O(1)\), as it only takes a very small number of steps to insert at the front of a list.
Considering the amount of time required to search this list, it is in the order of \(O(n)\), as in the worst case the entire list must always be searched to find an item. The time complexity for adding a new element to the list will depend on where that element is added. This is illustrated in the examples below.
Linked lists are not stored in a contiguous block of memory. They can grow as large as you wish, provided that enough system resources exist. The downside, however, is that more memory is required to keep track of the list instead of an array. This is because for each element, you must store not just the value of the element, but also a pointer to the next node. Further, linked lists cannot be indexed into like is possible in an array because we need to pass through the first \(n - 1\) elements to find the location of the \(n\)th element. Because of this, the list pictured above must be linearly searched. Binary search, therefore, is not possible in a list constructed as above.
Further, you could place numbers at the end of the list as illustrated in this code:
// Implements a list of numbers using a linked list
#include
<cs50.h>
#include
<stdio.h>
#include
<stdlib.h>
typedef
struct
node
{
int
number
;
struct
node
*
next
;
}
node
;
int
main
(
int
argc
,
char
*
argv
[])
{
// Memory for numbers
node
*
list
=
NULL
;
// For each command-line argument
for
(
int
i
=
1
;
i
<
argc
;
i
++
)
{
// Convert argument to int
int
number
=
atoi
(
argv
[
i
]);
// Allocate node for number
node
*
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof
(
node
));
if
(
n
==
NULL
)
{
return
1
;
}
n
->
number
=
number
;
n
->
next
=
NULL
;
// If list is empty
if
(
list
==
NULL
)
{
// This node is the whole list
list
=
n
;
}
// If list has numbers already
else
{
// Iterate over nodes in list
for
(
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
ptr
!=
NULL
;
ptr
=
ptr
->
next
)
{
// If at end of list
if
(
ptr
->
next
==
NULL
)
{
// Append node
ptr
->
next
=
n
;
break
;
}
}
}
}
// Print numbers
for
(
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
ptr
!=
NULL
;
ptr
=
ptr
->
next
)
{
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
ptr
->
number
);
}
// Free memory
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
while
(
ptr
!=
NULL
)
{
node
*
next
=
ptr
->
next
;
free
(
ptr
);
ptr
=
next
;
}
}
Notice how this code
walks down
this list to find the end. When appending an element, (adding to the end of the list) our code will run in \(O(n)\), as we have to go through our entire list before we can add the final element.
Further, you could sort your list as items are added:
// Implements a sorted list of numbers using a linked list
#include
<cs50.h>
#include
<stdio.h>
#include
<stdlib.h>
typedef
struct
node
{
int
number
;
struct
node
*
next
;
}
node
;
int
main
(
int
argc
,
char
*
argv
[])
{
// Memory for numbers
node
*
list
=
NULL
;
// For each command-line argument
for
(
int
i
=
1
;
i
<
argc
;
i
++
)
{
// Convert argument to int
int
number
=
atoi
(
argv
[
i
]);
// Allocate node for number
node
*
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof
(
node
));
if
(
n
==
NULL
)
{
return
1
;
}
n
->
number
=
number
;
n
->
next
=
NULL
;
// If list is empty
if
(
list
==
NULL
)
{
list
=
n
;
}
// If number belongs at beginning of list
else
if
(
n
->
number
<
list
->
number
)
{
n
->
next
=
list
;
list
=
n
;
}
// If number belongs later in list
else
{
// Iterate over nodes in list
for
(
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
ptr
!=
NULL
;
ptr
=
ptr
->
next
)
{
// If at end of list
if
(
ptr
->
next
==
NULL
)
{
// Append node
ptr
->
next
=
n
;
break
;
}
// If in middle of list
if
(
n
->
number
<
ptr
->
next
->
number
)
{
n
->
next
=
ptr
->
next
;
ptr
->
next
=
n
;
break
;
}
}
}
}
// Print numbers
for
(
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
ptr
!=
NULL
;
ptr
=
ptr
->
next
)
{
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
ptr
->
number
);
}
// Free memory
node
*
ptr
=
list
;
while
(
ptr
!=
NULL
)
{
node
*
next
=
ptr
->
next
;
free
(
ptr
);
ptr
=
next
;
}
}
Notice how this list is sorted as it is built. To insert an element in this specific order, our code will still run in \(O(n)\) for each insertion, as in the worst case we will have to look through all current elements.
Trees
Binary search trees
are another data structure that can be used to store data more efficiently  such that it can be searched and retrieved.
You can imagine a sorted sequence of numbers.
Imagine then that the center value becomes the top of a tree. Those that are less than this value are placed to the left. Those values that are more than this value are to the right.
Pointers can then be used to point to the correct location of each area of memory such that each of these nodes can be connected.
In code, this can be implemented as follows.
// Implements a list of numbers as a binary search tree
#include
<stdio.h>
#include
<stdlib.h>
// Represents a node
typedef
struct
node
{
int
number
;
struct
node
*
left
;
struct
node
*
right
;
}
node
;
void
free_tree
(
node
*
root
);
void
print_tree
(
node
*
root
);
int
main
(
void
)
{
// Tree of size 0
node
*
tree
=
NULL
;
// Add number to list
node
*
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof
(

));
if
(
n
==

)
{
return
1
;
}
n

number
=
2
;
n
->
left
=
NULL
;
n

=
NULL
;
tree
=
n
;
// Add number to list
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof

if
(
n
==

)
{
free_tree
(
tree
);
return
1
;
}
n

=
1
;
n

;
n

;
tree

;
// Add number to list
n
=
malloc
(
sizeof

if
(
n

)
{
free_tree
(
tree
);
return
1
;
}
n
->
number
=
3
;
n

left
=
NULL
;
n
->
right
=
NULL
;
tree
->
right
=
n
;
// Print tree
print_tree
(
tree
);
// Free tree
free_tree
(
tree
);
return
0
;
}
void
free_tree
(
node
*
root
)
{
if
(
root
==
NULL
)
{
return
;
}
free_tree
(
root

free_tree
(

free
(
root
);
}
void
print_tree
(
node
*

)
{
if
(
root
==

)
{
return
;
}
print_tree
(
root
->
left
);
printf
(
"%i
\n
"
,
root
->
number
);
print_tree
(
root
->
right
);
}
Notice this search function begins by going to the location of
tree
. Then, it uses recursion to search for
number
. The
free_tree
function recursively frees the tree.
print_tree
recursively prints the tree.
A tree like the above offers dynamism that an array does not offer. It can grow and shrink as we wish.
Further, this structure offers a search time of \(O(log n)\).
Dictionaries
Dictionaries
are another data structure.
Dictionaries, like actual book-form dictionaries that have a word and a definition, have a
key
and a
value
.
The
holy grail
of algorithmic time complexity is \(O(1)\) or
constant time
. That is, the ultimate is for access to be instantaneous.
Dictionaries can offer this speed of access through hashing.
Hashing and Hash Tables
Hashing
is the idea of taking a value and being able to output a value that becomes a shortcut to it later.
For example, hashing
apple
may hash as a value of
1
, and
berry
may be hashed as
2
. Therefore, finding
apple
is as easy as asking the
hash
algorithm where
apple
is stored. While not ideal in terms of design, ultimately, putting all
a
âs in one bucket and
b
âs in another, this concept of
bucketizing
hashed values illustrates how you can use this concept: a hashed value can be used to shortcut finding such a value.
A
hash function
is an algorithm that reduces a larger value to something small and predictable. Generally, this function takes in an item you wish to add to your hash table, and returns an integer representing the array index in which the item should be placed.
A
hash table
is a fantastic combination of both arrays and linked lists. When implemented in code, a hash table is an
array
of
pointers
to
node
s.
A hash table could be imagined as follows:
Notice that this is an array that is assigned each value of the alphabet.
Then, at each location of the array, a linked list is used to track each value being stored there:
Collisions
are when you add values to the hash table, and something already exists at the hashed location. In the above, collisions are simply appended to the end of the list.
Collisions can be reduced by better programming your hash table and hash algorithm. You can imagine an improvement upon the above as follows:
Consider the following example of a hash algorithm:
This could be implemented in code as:
#include
<ctype.h>
unsigned
int
hash
(
const
char
*
word
)
{
return
toupper
(
word
[
0
])
-
'A'
;
}
Notice how the hash function returns the value of
toupper(word[0]) - 'A'
.
You, as the programmer, have to make a decision about the advantages of using more memory to have a large hash table and potentially reducing search time or using less memory and potentially increasing search time.
Tries
Tries
are another form of data structure.
Tries
are always searchable in constant time.
One downside to
Tries
is that they tend to take up a large amount of memory. Notice that we need \(26 \times 4 = 104\)
node
s just to store
Toad
!
Toad
would be stored as follows:
Tom
would then be stored as follows:
The downside of this structure is how many resources are required to use it.
