Welcome!
This class is about more than computer programming!
Indeed, this class is about problem-solving in a way that is exceedingly empowering! You will likely take the problem solving that you learn here will likely be instantly applicable to your work beyond this course and even your career as a whole!
However, it will not be easy! You will be âdrinking from the firehoseâ of knowledge during this course. Youâll be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish in the coming weeks.
This course is far more about you advancing âyouâ from âwhere you are todayâ than hitting some imagined standard.
The most important opening consideration in this course: Give the time you need to learn through this course. Everyone learns differently. If something does not work out well at the start, know that with time you will grow and grow in your skill.
Donât be scared if this is your first computer science class! For most of your peers, this is their first computer science class too!
Whatâs Ahead
You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.
Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:
#include
<stdio.h>
int
main
(
void
)
{
printf
(
"hello, world
\n
"
);
}
Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about algorithms.
You will learn about memory.
You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.
You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.
Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language called
Python
. Your code will look something like this:
print
(
"
hello, world
"
)
This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed from the earlier ones.
You will learn SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web applications.

Computer Science
Essentially, computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a problem. What happens in between the input and output, what we could call
a black box,
is the focus of this course.
For example, we may need to take attendance for a class. We could use a system called
unary
to count, one finger at a time.
Computers today count using a system called
binary
. Itâs from the term
binary digit
that we get a familiar term called
bit
. A
bit
is a zero or one: on or off.
Computers only speak in terms of zeros and ones. Zeros represent
off.
Ones represent
on.
Computers are millions, and perhaps billions, of transistors that are being turned on and off.
If you imagine using a light bulb, a single bulb can only count from zero to one.
However, if you were to have three light bulbs, there are more options open to you!
Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:
0 0 0
Similarly, the following would represent one:
0 0 1
By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:
0 1 0
Extending this logic further, the following represents three:
0 1 1
Four would appear as:
1 0 0
We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!
1 1 1
As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our
binary digit
:
4 2 1
Computers use âbase-2â to count. This can be pictured as follows:
2^2  2^1  2^0
4    2    1
Therefore, you could say that it would require three bits (the fourâs place, the twoâs place, and the oneâs place) to represent a number as high as seven.
Computers generally use eight bits (also known as a
byte
) to represent a number. For example,
00000101
is the number 5 in
binary
.
11111111
represents the number 255.
ASCII
Just as numbers are binary patterns of ones and zeros, letters are represented using ones and zeros too!
Since there is an overlap between the ones and zeros that represent numbers and letters, the
ASCII
standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
For example, the letter
A
was decided to map to the number 65.
01000001
represents the number 65 in binary.
If you received a text message, the binary under that message might represent the numbers 72, 73, and 33. Mapping these out to ASCII, your message would look as follows:
H   I   !
72  73  33
Thank goodness for standards like ASCII that allow us to agree upon these values!
Here is an expanded map of ASCII values:
If you wish, you can learn more about
ASCII
.
Since binary can only count up to
255
we are limited to the number of characters represented by ASCII.
Unicode
As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.
Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that could be represented by humans, the
Unicode
standard expanded the number of bits that can be transmitted and understood by computers. Unicode includes not only special characters, but emoji as well.
There are emoji that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:
Computer scientists faced a challenge when wanting to assign various skin tones to each emoji to allow the communication to be further personalized. In this case, the creators and contributors of emoji decided that the initial bits would be the structure of the emoji itself, followed by skin tone.
For example, the unicode for a generic thumbs up is
U+1F44D
. However, the following represents the same thumbs up with a different skin tone:
U+1F44D U+1F3FD
.
More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters and emoji.
If you wish, you can learn more about
Unicode
.
If you wish, you can learn more about
emoji
.
Representation
Zeros and ones can be used to represent color.
Red, green, and blue (called
RGB
) is a combination of three numbers.
Taking our previously used 72, 73, and 33, which said
HI!
via text, would be interpreted by image readers as a light shade of yellow. The red value would be 72, the green value would be 73, and the blue would be 33.
Further, zeros and ones can be used to represent images, videos, and music!
Images are simply collections of RGB values.
Videos are sequences of many images that are stored together, just like a flipbook.
Music can be represented through MIDI data.
Algorithms
Problem-solving is central to computer science and computer programming.
Imagine the basic problem of trying to locate a single name in a phone book.
How might you go about this?
One approach could be to simply read from page one to the next to the next until reaching the last page.
Another approach could be to search two pages at a time.
A final and perhaps better approach could be to go to the middle of the phone book and ask, âIs the name I am looking for to the left or to the right?â Then, repeat this process, cutting the problem in half and half and half.
Each of these approaches could be called algorithms. The speed of each of these algorithms can be pictured as follows in what is called
big-O notation
:
Notice that the first algorithm, highlighted in red, has a big-O of
n
because if there are 100 names in the phone book, it could take up to 100 tries to find the correct name. The second algorithm, where two pages were searched at a time, has a big-O of ân/2â because we searched twice as fast through the pages. The final algorithm has a big-O of log
2
n as doubling the problem would only result in one more step to solve the problem.
Pseudocode
The ability to create
pseudocode
is central to oneâs success in both this class and in computer programming.
Pseudocode is a human-readable version of your code. For example, considering the third algorithm above, we could compose pseudocode as follows:
1  Pick up phone book
2  Open to middle of phone book
3  Look at page
4  If person is on page
5      Call person
6  Else if person is earlier in book
7      Open to middle of left half of book
8      Go back to line 3
9  Else if person is later in book
10     Open to middle of right half of book
11     Go back to line 3
12 Else
13     Quit
Pseudocoding is such an important skill for at least two reasons. First, when you pseudocode before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance. Second, when you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding decisions and how your code works.
Notice that the language within our pseudocode has some unique features. First, some of these lines begin with verbs like
pick up,
open,
look at.
Later, we will call these
functions
.
Second, notice that some lines include statements like
if
or
else if.
These are called
conditionals
.
Third, notice how there are expressions that can be stated as
true
or
false,
such as âperson is earlier in the book.â We call these
boolean expressions
.
Finally, notice how these statements like âgo back to line 3.â We call these
loops
.
These building blocks are the fundamentals of programming.
In the context of
Scratch
, which is discussed below, we will use each of the above basic building blocks of programming.
Artificial Intelligence
Consider how we can utilize the building blocks above to start creating our own artificial intelligence. Look at the following pseudocode:
If student says hello
    Say hello back
Else if student says goodbye
    Say goodbye back
Else if student asks how you are
    Say you're well
Else if student asks why 111 in binary is 7 in decimal
...
Notice how just to program a handful of interactions, many lines of code would be required. How many lines of code would be required for thousands or tens of thousands of possible interactions?
large language models
look at patterns in large blocks of language. Such language models attempt to create a best guess of what words come after one another or alongside one another.
As very useful in many avenues of life and work, we stipulate that the utilization of AI-based software other than CS50âs own is
not reasonable
.
CS50âs own AI-based software tool called
CS50 Duck
is an AI helper that you can use during this course. It will help you, but not give away the entire answers to the courseâs problems.
Scratch
Scratch
is a visual programming language developed by MIT.
Scratch utilizes the same essential coding building blocks that we covered earlier in this lecture.
Scratch is a great way to get into computer programming because it allows you to play with these building blocks in a visual manner, not having to be concerned about the syntax of curly braces, semicolons, parentheses, and the like.
Scratch
IDE
(integrated development environment) looks like the following:
Notice that on the left, there are
building blocks
that you can use in your programming. To the immediate right of the building blocks, there is the area to which you can drag blocks to build a program. To the right of that, you see the
stage
where a cat stands. The stage is where your programming comes to life.
Scratch operates on a coordinate system as follows:
Notice that the center of the stage is at coordinate (0,0). Right now, the catâs position is at that same position.
Hello World
To begin, drag the âwhen green flag clickedâ building block to the programming area. Then, drag the
say
building block to the programming area and attach it to the previous block.
when green flag clicked
say [hello, world]
Notice that when you click the green flag now, on the stage, the cat says, âhello world.â
This illustrates quite well what we were discussing earlier regarding programming:
Notice that the input
hello world
is passed to the function
say
, and the
side effect
of that function running is the cat saying
hello world
.
Hello, You
We can make your program more interactive by having the cat say
hello
to someone specific. Modify your program as below:
when green flag clicked
ask [What's your name?] and wait
say (join [hello,] (answer))
Notice that when the green flag is clicked, the function
ask
is run. The program prompts you, the user,
What's your name?
It then stores that name in the
variable
called
answer
. The program then passes
answer
to a special function called
join
, which combines two strings of text
hello
, and whatever name was provided. These collectively are passed to the
say
function. The cat says,
Hello,
and a name. Your program is now interactive.
Quite similarly, we can modify our program as follows:
when green flag clicked
ask [What's your name?] and wait
speak (join [hello,] (answer))
Notice that this program, when the green flag is clicked, passes the same variable, joined with
hello
, to a function called
speak
.
Meow and Abstraction
Along with pseudocoding,
abstraction
is an essential skill and concept within computer programming.
Abstraction is the act of simplifying a problem into smaller and smaller problems.
For example, if you were hosting a huge dinner for your friends, the
problem
of having to cook the entire meal could be quite overwhelming! However, if you break down the task of cooking the meal into smaller and smaller tasks (or problems), the big task of creating this delicious meal might feel less challenging.
In programming, and even within Scratch, we can see abstraction in action. In your programming area, program as follows:
when green flag clicked
play sound (Meow v) until done
wait (1) seconds
play sound (Meow v) until done
wait (1) seconds
play sound (Meow v) until done
Notice that you are doing the same thing over and over again. Indeed, if you see yourself repeatedly coding the same statements, itâs likely the case that you could program more artfully â abstracting away this repetitive code.
You can modify your code as follows:
when green flag clicked
repeat (3)
play sound (Meow v) until done
wait (1) seconds
Notice that the loop does exactly as the previous program did. However, the problem is simplified by abstracting away the repetition to a block that
repeats
the code for us.
We can even advance this further by using the
define
block, where you can create your own block (your own function)! Write code as follows:
define meow
play sound (Meow v) until done
wait (1) seconds

when green flag clicked
repeat (3)
meow
Notice that we are defining our own block called
meow
. The function plays the sound
meow
, then waits one second. Below that, you can see that when the green flag is clicked, our meow function is repeated three times.
We can even provide a way by which the function can take an input
n
and repeat a number of times:
define meow n times
repeat (n)
 play sound [meow v] until done
 wait (1) seconds
Notice how
n
is taken from âmeow n times.â
n
is passed to the meow function through the
define
block.
The cat, by the way, we can call a
sprite
â a general term used in game programming for an object or character on the screen with which the player will interact.
Conditionals
conditionals
are an essential building block of programming, where the program looks to see if a specific condition has been met. If a condition is met, the program does something.
To illustrate a conditional, write code as follows:
when green flag clicked
forever
if <touching (mouse-pointer v)?> then
play sound (Meow v) until done
Notice that the
forever
block is utilized such that the
if
block is triggered over and over again, such that it can check continuously if the cat is touching the mouse pointer.
We can modify our program as follows to integrate video sensing:
when video motion > (50)
play sound (Meow v) until done
Remember, programming is often a process of trial and error. If you get frustrated, take time to talk yourself through the problem at hand. What is the specific problem that you are working on right now? What is working? What is not working?
Oscartime
We showed you in this lecture a number of Scratch programs to stoke your imagination.
Oscartime
is one of Davidâs own Scratch programs â though the music may haunt him because of the number of hours he listened to it while creating this program. Take a few moments to play through the game yourself.
Building Oscartime ourselves, we first add the lamp post.
Then, write code as follows:
when green flag clicked
switch costume to (oscar1 v)
forever
if <touching (mouse-pointer v)?> then
switch costume to (oscar2 v)
else
switch costume to (oscar1 v)
Notice that moving your mouse over Oscar changes his costume. You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Then, modify your code as follow to create a falling piece of trash:
when green flag clicked
go to x: (pick random (-240) to (240)) y: (180)
forever
if <(distance to (floor v)) > (0)> then
change y by (-3)
Notice that the trashâs position on the y-axis always begins at 180. The x position is randomized. While the trash is above the floor, it goes down 3 pixels at a time. You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Next, modify your code as follows to allow for the possibility of dragging trash.
when green flag clicked
forever
if <<mouse down?> and <touching (mouse-pointer v) ?>> then
go to (mouse-pointer v)
You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Next, we can implement the scoring variables as follows:
when green flag clicked
forever
if <touching (Oscar v) ?> then
change (score) by (1)
go to x: (pick random (-240) to (240)) y: (180)
You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Go try the full game
Oscartime
.
Ivyâs Hardest Game
Moving away from Oscartime to Ivyâs Hardest Game, we can now imagine how to implement movement within our program.
Our program has three main components.
First, write code as follows:
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
forever
listen for keyboard
feel for walls
Notice that when the green flag is clicked, our sprite moves to the center of the stage at coordinates (0,0) and then listens for the keyboard and checks for walls forever.
Second, add this second group of code blocks:
define listen for keyboard
if <key (up arrow v) pressed?> then
change y by (1)
end
if <key (down arrow v) pressed?> then
change y by (-1)
end
if <key (right arrow v) pressed?> then
change x by (1)
end
if <key (left arrow v) pressed?> then
change x by (-1)
end
Notice how we have created a custom
listen for keyboard
script. For each of our arrow keys on the keyboard, it will move the sprite around the screen.
Finally, add this group of code blocks:
define feel for walls
if <touching (left wall v) ?> then
change x by (1)
end
if <touching (right wall v) ?> then
change x by (-1)
end
Notice how we also have a custom
feel for walls
script. When a sprite touches a wall, it moves it back to a safe position â preventing it from walking off the screen.
You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Go try the full game
Ivyâs Hardest Game
.
Scratch allows for many sprites to be on the screen at once.
Adding another sprite, add the following code blocks to your program:
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
point in direction (90)
forever
if <<touching (left wall v)?> or <touching (right wall v)?>> then
turn right (180) degrees
end
move (1) steps
end
Notice how the Yale sprite seems to get in the way of the Harvard sprite by moving back and forth. When it bumps into a wall, it turns around until it bumps the wall again. You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
You can even make a sprite follow another sprite. Adding another sprite, add the following code blocks to your program:
when green flag clicked
go to (random position v)
forever
point towards (Harvard v)
move (1) steps
Notice how the MIT logo now seems to follow around the Harvard one. You can learn more by
exploring these code blocks
.
Go try the full game
